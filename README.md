# Problems-on-DSA
Problems on DSA is designed and selected  by Sachin sir.

Here, the problems are based on diffrent difficulty level which will be uploaded as topic will be covered in class, These problems are basic to standard level so that we will quench our thrist by solving these problems.

**Tips** :

Solve these problems first and try to come with (at least) brute force solution, find the time complexity of brute force then go ahead to minimise it. during this period of time if you stuck more then 1-2hrs, lookup for the hint and read all theoritical knowledge about algorithm,concept, etc which will be used in these problems.

if you still not able to implement optimal solution then go to solutions and always think about how to minimise 
time-complexity. it will lead you to the better solution.

#Remember: **Practice Practice and Practice is the only key of CP.**
